# Carla-Simulator
This repository contains the projects I made with Carla Simulator.
## AEBS & ACC
There will be a coach car preceding our car and all we have to do is to follow its and stop our car after it stops to avoid collision. Furthermore, we should maintain an appropriate distance, that is, we should keep a distance that isn't too far but also long enough for we to take reaction after the coach car stops.
## Waypoints tracking
There will be 25 waypoints set in the map. We have to follow these points to go through curve without collision.
